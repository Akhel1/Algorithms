#Bucket Sort Algorithm

"""Bucket Sort is a sorting technique that sorts the elements by first dividing the elements into several groups called buckets. 
The elements inside each bucket are sorted using any of the suitable sorting algorithms or recursively calling the same algorithm.
"""

#Pseudo code

"""
bucketSort()
  create N buckets each of which can hold a range of values
  for all the buckets
    initialize each bucket with 0 values
  for all the buckets
    put elements into buckets matching the range
  for all the buckets 
    sort elements in each bucket
  gather elements from each bucket
